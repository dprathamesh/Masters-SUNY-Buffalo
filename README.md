The project has been divided into 4 different parts:
1) Data Preprocessing and EDA - In this phase, we implemented 10 + methods like removing duplicates, trimming spaces, removing outliers etc. to clean the NYC Collisions dataset. (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95/about_data)
   We also performed EDA techniques to gather insights from the data. For e.g. top cities that has maximum collisions, top vehicles involved etc.

2) Applying Machine Learning to predict the possibility of crashes / collisions at any point (intersection).

3) Converting the same ML models into PySpark models to enhance the processing speed and implement distributed network.

4) Summarizing the outcome and creating a quick dashboard.
